# ft_ls

ft_ls is a 42 Project where you recreate the famous ls command you mostly use of linux and mac.

## Features

We recreate it in the mandatory part only with the following flags :
`-a` : Displays all files ( so basically displays all files that start with a '.',
`-r` : Reverse the order of all files,
`-t` : Sort files by the time they were lastly modified by ns,
`-R` : Make it open folder to find files recursively,
`-a` : Display info in following format `permission links user group date_of_modification name_of_file`.
I added the following flags :
`-c` : Adds colors to certain file / folder type just like the eza command,
`--help` : Displays an help message.

Even thought this subject can be done without doing the norminette i followed most of it to make the challenge more difficult.

This project is a W.I.P.
